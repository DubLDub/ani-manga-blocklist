2 blacklists / blocklists containing only the domains for content filtering , which is currently missing since I didn't find anything while searching for it.
Feel free to contribute

Make sure to download the list, and do a grep before contributing the domain.
Furthermore, after downloading the list , do a 
```
cat list.txt | sort -u > newlist.txt
```
To make sure that the domains are sorted and unique.
