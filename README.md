# ani-manga-blocklist
2 blacklists / blocklists containing only the domains for content filtering , which is currently missing since I didn't find anything while searching for it.
Feel free to contribute


# I want to contribute (website is not on the list)
Make sure to download the list, and do a grep before contributing the domain.
Furthermore, after downloading the list , do a 
```
cat list.txt | sort -u > newlist.txt
```
To make sure that the domains are sorted and unique.

# Which list should I be using?
I'd go with refined-blacklist.txt which is hand checked, and that's the one you should contribute as well.
In cae you want to go big, you can also use the joined blacklist.
